Before we start learning multi threading we first need to understand how a regular program runs.

PROGRAMS run from the top to bottom fashion which means it has ONE PATH OF EXECUTION.

However a MULTI THREADED PROGRAM can actually have TWO OR MORE PATHS OF EXECUTION which can run concurrently.

So a THREAD is a path of execution.
Hence a program with multiple paths of execution are called as MULTI THREADED PROGRAMS.

MULTI THREADING is a part of MULTI TASKING.

To understand MULTI THREADING in a better way, let's discuss about MULTI TASKING FIRST.

******************* MULTI TASKING *****************

Basic example of MULTI TASKING is using a browser window and IDE simultaneously.

                  -------  PROCESS BASED 
                  |
MULTITASKING  ---- 
                  |
                  -------- THREAD BASED

** PROCESS BASED MULTITASKING **:- Allows us to run two or more programs simultaneously.
Examples :- Using browser and IDE the same time.

=> In this case the IDE and the BROWSER are actually run by two different processes meaning one process which runs the browser and
   
   another process which actually runs the IDE.
   
=> This is called as PROCESS BASED MULTITASKING which means two different programs running on their own.


** THREAD BASED MULTITASKING ** :- It allows us to perform multiple tasks in a single program.
Example:- In a music player, we can search and listen to the song at the same time.
